Main Goal: The goal of my kid's toy is to make electromagnetic building blocks that are able to be turned on and off.  This will allow some blocks to “float” while the magnets are on and will drop when it is turned off. 

Goals I’d like to accomplish:
Add an Arduino display that tells you what to build
Find a way to detect if the shapes are in the correct positions
Use a raspberry pi and LCD to display a more 3d version of the blocks instead of the Arduino display
Have a “Destroy” button on the LCD to turn off the electromagnets
Add in a motor to tilt the tower so they will all fall instead of just the ones hanging.
